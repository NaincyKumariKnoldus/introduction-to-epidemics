Written at the height of the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, the book aims to
demystify the science that underlies epidemic modelling and the policy
responses we can make to disease outbreaks. It makes a unique
combination of accessible text, introductory mathematics, and Python
code available to anyone with an interest in science.
