<h1>Disease progression<a class="headerlink" href="#disease-progression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Everyone suffers from a disease at some point. The lucky amongst us
avoid anything more serious that influenza, measles, or (in my case,
long ago) whooping cough. But all diseases share some common
characteristics: characteristics so common, in fact, that their
mathematical properties are shared by other processes that aren’t
actually diseases at all, including the spread of computer viruses
<a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#kw91" id="id1">[11]</a> and the spread of rumours and other information.</p>
<p>The diseases in which we are interested are caused by <em>pathogens</em>,
typically viruses or bacteria: simple living organisms that make their
homes in humans (or other living organisms) and cause some adverse
reaction as a result of their lifecycle. These pathogens can pass
between individuals in a number of ways, causing the disease to
spread. A disease might be <strong>airborne</strong>, able to live in the air and
be breathed by passing individuals. It might be spread by
<strong>droplets</strong>, coughed and sneezed into the environment or deposited on
objects and picked up by future physical contact with the contaminated
surfaces. Or it might be communicable only by <strong>direct physical
contact</strong>, skin to skin, through sex, or a blood transfusion. It might
be <strong>foodborne</strong>, transmitted through contaminated food that infects
several people from a common source. It might be <strong>vectored</strong> through
an animal, as is the case for malaria which has to be sporead by
mosquitoes and can’t spread person-to-person. Even diseases that
don’t <em>require</em> a vector may still incubate in animal hosts <em>as well</em>
as in humans (this is suspected in the case of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic">1918 “Spanish flu”
pandemic</a>
<a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#osj02" id="id2">[18]</a>). And finally there is a class of <strong>non-communicable</strong>
diseases such as cancer or heart disease, some of which are
<strong>hereditary</strong>: not caused directly by pathogens but perhaps
influenced by their presence, and perhaps made worse by infections.</p>
<p>Each different kind of disease will have its own characteristic
<strong>pathology</strong>, how it affects the body of a person infected. It will
also have its own <strong>epidemiology</strong> that controls how it
spreads. Clinically, both these characteristics are extremely
important; we will focus here on the epidemiology, but the pathology
remains important because factors involved in how a disease
progresses <em>in</em> individuals may have a profound effect on how it
spreads <em>between</em> individuals.</p>
<div class="section" id="sec-progress-periods">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Disease progression<a class="headerlink" href="#sec-progress-periods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A person’s infection goes through several periods, starting with their
<strong>infection</strong>. Once infected, the disease resides <strong>latent</strong> in their
system, developing its presence but not showing symptoms and not being
infectious to others. After this latent period the disease becomes
<strong>infectious</strong>, capable of being spread to others. Typically a
person’s infectiousness peaks and dies away before the end of the
disease progression.</p>
<p><img alt="Disease stages" src="_images/disease-periods.png" /></p>
<p>These two periods – latent and infectious – control the
<strong>transmission</strong> of infection. After initial infection there
will be an <strong>incubation</strong> period before the person shows symptoms of the
disease. After the onset of symptoms, the disease progresses and ends
in some <strong>resolution</strong>: the patient gets better, or dies. If they
recover, they may then have some immunity to further infection.</p>
<p>For different diseases, the lengths of these periods and the ways they
overlap vary. For <strong>Type A</strong> diseases, the incubation period is longer
than the latent period. This means that a patient can start to
transmit the disease before the disease becomes manifest in
themselves. This happens in cases of measles. In <strong>Type B</strong> diseases
such as SARS or ebola, by contrast, the incubation period is shorter
than the latent period, meaning that asymptomatic patients cannot
infect others. So despite ebola being a more feared disease than
measles, it may be easier to treat epidemiologically since
quarantining patients showing symptoms will prevent transmission in
the general population (although not to medical staff); in measles,
transmission starts before symptoms show themselves, so quarantine
based on symptoms is less effective. Moreover for some disease the
infectious period may continue after the patient has died: the corpses
of victims of ebola, which is transmitted <em>via</em> bodily fluids, can be
extremely infectious for some time after death, meaning that funerals
become very dangerous loci of potential infection for mourners.</p>
<p><img alt="Disease types" src="_images/disease-types.png" /></p>
<p>How long do the different periods last? For each disease there will be
typical durations, often with substantial variance. In the case of
ebola, for example, a typical timeline would be a 0–3 day
incubation period, a 7–12 day progression to recovery or death,
and a latent period of 2–5 days. The ranges give the variance of
periods, different for different individuals that depend on factors
including the severity of infection and the individual’s overall
health. However, the incubation period for ebola can be up to 21 days,
meaning that a suspected case needs to be quarantined for this period:
long enough, in other words, for the disease symptoms to manifest if
the person is actually infected. While one can test for most diseases
(including ebola) in a laboratory, during an epidemic such tests may
overwhelm the public health infrastructure, making quarantine the most
practical option. (During historical disease outbreaks, of course,
quarantine was the <em>only</em> option.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="measuring-and-modelling-epidemics">
<span id="sec-progress-r0"></span><h2>Measuring and modelling epidemics<a class="headerlink" href="#measuring-and-modelling-epidemics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Epidemiology is the science of creating models of diseases and their
spread that can be analysed, to make predictions or to simulate the
effects of different responses. To do this, we need to identify the
core elements of a disease from the perspective of transmission: we
typically do not need to understand the disease’s detailed biology,
only the timings and other factors that affect its spread.</p>
<p>We discussed above the periods of diseases, their relationships, and
their different, often characteristics, periods and variances. We need
some other numbers as well, however, and it turns out that these can
be measured directly in the field.</p>
<p>The most important number is the <strong>basic case reproduction number</strong>,
denoted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> represents the total number of secondary
infections expected for each primary infection in a totally
susceptible population. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> stands for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t = 0\)</span>: the basic
case reproduction number applies at the start of an epidemic. Over the
course of an epidemic the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> will change as people become
immune post-infection, countermeasures take effect, and so forth, and
give rise to a <strong>net case reproduction number</strong> indicating how the
disease is reproducing at a given time..</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}_0\)</span> is affected by three factors:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>duration of infectiousness</strong>. All other things being equal, a
disease with a longer period of infectiousness has more time in which
to infect other patients.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>probability of transmission</strong> at each contact. Some diseases are
extremely contagious, with each contact having a high probability of
passing on the infection; others are much harder to pass on to
secondary cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>rate of contact</strong>. Someone coming into contact with a lot of
susceptible individuals will have more opportunities to generate a
secondary case than someone meeting fewer people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two factors are characteristic of the disease, derived from
its biology. The third is characteristic of the social conditions in
which the epidemic takes place: it is this factor that social
distancing, quarantine and so forth affect, by reducing (ideally to
zero) the contacts an infected person has with uninfected individuals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-importance-of-mathcal-r">
<span id="sec-progress-r"></span><h2>The importance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#the-importance-of-mathcal-r" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The importance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> is that it indicates whether, and how fast, a
disease can spread through a susceptible population. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R} \lt 1\)</span> then
we expect fewer than one secondary case per primary. This means that
each “generation” of the disease will be smaller than the one that
infected it, and the disease will die out. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R} = 1\)</span> then the
disease will perpetuate itself in whatever size of population was
originally infected. Nature is never so precise as to present us with
a disease like this, of course. However, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R} = 1\)</span> is the <strong>threshold
value</strong> at which diseases become epidemics. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R} &gt; 1\)</span>, the
disease will break-out and infect more and more people exponentially
quickly.</p>
<p>Exactly <em>how</em> quickly depends on how large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> is. For measles, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}
\ge 15\)</span> – fifteen new infections for each case – which
explains how measles spread so quickly in unvaccinated
populations. Different strains of influenza have different ranges of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span>: for the 1918 “Spanish flu” it has been
estimated <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#vtm07" id="id4">[27]</a> that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.2 \le \mathcal{R} \le 3.0\)</span> in the community
(although substantially more in confined settings). If this sounds
benign, remember that this epidemic killed more people than the First
World War. Perhaps interesting in light of its media coverage, for
ebola we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.5 \le \mathcal{R} \le 2.7\)</span> <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#alt14" id="id5">[2]</a>, roughly the same as
a not-too-severe winter flu outbreak.</p>
<p>In a typical epidemic the number of people infected grows very
quickly. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R} = 2\)</span> then one person infects two others, who
each infect two others, who each … and so on – so each generation
is twice as big as the last). If you plot the size of the epidemic
against time on a graph, it’ll draw out an <strong>exponential curve</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-we-need-to-be-careful-about-mathcal-r">
<span id="sec-progress-r-care"></span><h2>Why we need to be careful about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#why-we-need-to-be-careful-about-mathcal-r" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This sounds like good news: if we know <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span>, we can estimate the size
of the epidemic we’re facing; if we calculate it on an on-going basis
we can monitor how well any countermeasures we deploy are working, and
decide when to relax those countermeasures.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. There are at least four reasons that mean we need to
be careful not to over-rely on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<p>This reason actually drives all the rest, because it acts as an
amplifier for everything concerning <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The first reason is mathematical. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> is the exponent of the equation
that controls the epidemic’s size. This is important, because it means
that epidemics behave <strong>non-linearly</strong>. An <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> value of 4 is not twice
as bad as an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> value of 2: the epidemic isn’t twice as big, <strong>it
doubles twice as many times</strong> in the same period. Small differences in
the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> therefore have huge effects.</p>
<p>It’s true that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R} = 1\)</span> is the critical value, below which an epidemic
dies out. But it doesn’t follow from this that an <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> value slightly
over 1 is “pretty much 1” and so not a worry. <strong>That non-linearity means
that even a small excess in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> can lead to a large outbreak</strong>. This has
implications for epidemic control too: reducing the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> value to just
below 1 isn’t an indication that everything will then be fine, as a
small increase may set things off again.</p>
<p>The second reason concerns estimation. The most effective way of
estimating <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> in the is <a class="reference internal" href="tracing.html"><span class="doc">contract tracing</span></a>, where
infected individuals’ contacts are located and tested – and can
then be treated or isolated if found to be infected
themselves. Careful and widespread “test, trace and isolate”
strategies can be extremely effective in reducing an epidemic. The
number of infected contacts individuals have on average lets us
estimate of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>But by definition <strong>test and trace is “counting in the rear view
mirror”</strong>. It tells us how many people <em>were being</em> infected, not how
many people <em>are being</em> infected. There will be a delay in identifying
infected individuals, further delay in finding and testing their
contacts, and so forth. If circumstances are changing, for example
through pathogen evolution or it infecting different social settings,
the estimate will be rendered out of date.</p>
<p>The third reason concerns the consequences of errors. <strong>Finding,
tracing, and counting of infected individuals is invariably
error-prone</strong>. People will be missed; tests are never 100% accurate,
especially for diseases with long incubation periods where there may
be low pathogen loads in the early stages; individuals forget whom
they were in contact with; tracing apps don’t work in all
circumstances; and so forth. Each of these errors leads to
under-counting secondary infections and therefore under-estimating
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally we must remember that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> is the <em>average</em> number of secondary
cases per primary. The use of averaging (and indeed other summary
statistics) is essential when trying to get the “big picture” of an
epidemic. But it means that the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> reported depends not just
on the disease but on the population being averaged over.</p>
<p>To see what this might mean, consider a country consisting of one city
surrounded by a collection of small villages – London in the
Middle Ages might be a good example. Suppose the disease breaks out
ferociously in the city but, because they are separated and take
precautions, the villages see a much sparser rate of infection. If we
were to take the net case reproduction rate <em>averaged over the city</em>
we’d capture all the ferocity of the epidemic’s spread. But if we
calculated the rate <em>over the whole country</em>, we’d see a far milder
epidemic. Because the same disease is spreading in different
circumstances, averaging may be misleading – too mild for the
city, but too large for the countryside. <strong>When interpreting an
average, you always need to know what population has been averaged
over</strong>. It is possible to manipulate the reported <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> value
accidentally, or deliberately by judicious choice of population.</p>
<p>For all these reasons it’s important not to fixate on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span>. The fact
that it’s a number can sometimes give a false sense of security,
because numbers suggest certainty and precision – and measuring
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> in the midst of an on-going epidemic offers neither. A value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> that’s reducing over time is a good sign. But <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> falling –
or <em>seeming</em> to fall – below 1 isn’t enough to prove that
countermeasures are working and can be relaxed.</p>

<div class="section" id="growth-rates">
<span id="sec-progress-rate"></span><h2>Growth rates<a class="headerlink" href="#growth-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the definition of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> doesn’t
include time. It’s essentially the ratio of the different sizes of two
“generations” of infection, and so tells us about the way the disease
reproduces itself in a population. But it <em>doesn’t</em> tell us <em>how fast</em>
that reproduction happens: how long does it take for the “next
generation” to come along?</p>
<p>Obviously the answer is something to do with the
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-progress-periods"><span class="std std-ref">latent period</span></a> we looked at earlier. The shorter the latent
period, the faster an infected person becomes infectious, and the
faster the epidemic will grow. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> tells us nothing useful
about this rate of growth.</p>
<p>Clearly this rate matters for tackling an outbreak, as well as for
modelling the progress of a disease in time. For this reason it’s
common to use another, complementary measure of epidemic behaviour.</p>
<p>When we talked about the <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-progress-r"><span class="std std-ref">exponential growth</span></a> in
epidemic size, we were still thinking in terms of generations of
disease. We can think in “real” time instead.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the size of an epidemic can be expressed as</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
	N(t) \propto e^{\lambda t} 
\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> is the number of cases at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> (measured in some
units) and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is the <strong>growth rate</strong>, the number of new cases
that appear per unit of time. The utility of this is that if we know
the growth rate per day <em>and</em> we know how many disease cases we have
<em>now</em>, we can predict how many diseases cases we’ll have <em>later</em>,
tomorrow (or even farther into the future) – and more importantly
we’ll know the answer in terms of days, not in terms of disease
generations. Even more importantly, we can get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> directly from
time series such as the number of diagnoses cases by <strong>fitting</strong> a
theoretical curve to the collected data.</p>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<p>A threshold value is an example of what mathematicians call a
<em>seperatrix</em>, a value that divides two regimes of qualitatively
different behaviour – growing or shrinking, in this case.</p>
</div>
<p>Just as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> had a threshold at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R} = 1\)</span> that
determined whether the epidemic was growing or shrinking, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda
= 0\)</span> divides growing (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda \gt 1\)</span>) from shrinking (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda \lt
0\)</span>) conditions. And just like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span>, we need to be careful
about reading too much into that: mistakes or omissions in reporting
the ongoing cases can easily cause and over- or under-estimate of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>The values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> are mathematically related,
of course, with the former being found by integrating the latter
<a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#wl07" id="id6">[28]</a>. In fact we can make <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> capture just the
biological part of the disease’s spread, while capturing things like
social issues and countermeasures separately as a probability
distribution of infections over time.</p>
