<h1>The progession of a disease<a class="headerlink" href="#the-progession-of-a-disease" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Everyone suffers from a disease at some point. The lucky amongst us
avoid anything more serious that influenza, measles, or (in my case,
long ago) whooping cough. But all diseases share some common
characteristics: characteristics so common, in fact, that their
mathematical properties are shared by other processes that aren’t
actually diseases at all, including the spread of computer viruses
<a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#kw91" id="id1">[KW91]</a> and the spread of rumours and other information.</p>
<p>The diseases in which we are interested are caused by <em>pathogens</em>,
typically viruses or bacteria: simple living organisms that make their
homes in humans (or other living organisms) and cause some adverse
reaction as a result of their lifecycle. These pathogens can pass
between individuals in a number of ways, causing the disease to
spread. A disease might be <strong>airborne</strong>, able to live in the air and
be breathed by passing individuals. It might be spread by
<strong>droplets</strong>, coughed and sneezed into the environment or deposited on
objects and picked up by future physical contact with the contaminated
surfaces. Or it might be communicable only by <strong>direct physical
contact</strong>, skin to skin, through sex, or a blood transfusion. It might
be <strong>foodborne</strong>, transmitted through contaminated food that infects
several people from a common source. It might be <strong>vectored</strong> through
an animal, as is the case for malaria. And finally there is a class of
<strong>non-communicable</strong> diseases such as cancer or heart disease, some of
which are <strong>hereditary</strong>: not caused directly by pathogens but perhaps
influenced by their presence.</p>
<p>Each different kind of disease will have its own characteristic
<strong>pathology</strong>, how it affects the body of a person infected. It will
also have its own <strong>epidemiology</strong> that controls how it
spreads. Clinically, both these characteristics are extremely
important; we will focus here on the epidemiology, but the pathology
remains important because factors involved in how a disease
progresses <em>in</em> individuals may have a profound effect on how it
spreads <em>between</em> individuals.</p>
<div class="section" id="disease-progression">
<h2>Disease progression<a class="headerlink" href="#disease-progression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A person’s infection goes through several periods, starting with their
<strong>infection</strong>. Once infected, the disease resides <strong>latent</strong> in their
system, developing its presence but not showing symptoms and not being
infectious to others. After this latent period the disease becomes
<strong>infectious</strong>, capable of being spread to others. Typically a
person’s infectiousness peaks and dies away before the end of the
disease progression.</p>
<p><img alt="Disease stages" src="_images/disease-periods.png" /></p>
<p>These two periods – latent and infectious – control the
<strong>transmission</strong> of infection. After initial infection there
will be an <strong>incubation</strong> period before the person shows symptoms of the
disease. After the onset of symptoms, the disease progresses and ends
in some <strong>resolution</strong>: the patient gets better, or dies. If they
recover, they may then have some immunity to further infection.</p>
<p>For different diseases, the lengths of these periods and the ways they
overlap vary. For <strong>Type A</strong> diseases, the incubation period is longer
than the latent period. This means that a patient can start to
transmit the disease before the disease becomes manifest in
themselves. This happens in cases of measles. In <strong>Type B</strong> diseases
such as SARS or ebola, by contrast, the incubation period is shorter
than the latent period, meaning that asymptomatic patients cannot
infect others. So despite ebola being a more feared disease than
measles, it may be easier to treat epidemiologically since
quarantining patients showing symptoms will prevent transmission in
the general population (although not to medical staff); in measles,
transmission starts before symptoms show themselves, so quarantine
based on symptoms is less effective. Moreover for some disease the
infectious period may continue after the patient has died: the corpses
of victims of ebola, which is transmitted <em>via</em> bodily fluids, can be
extremely infectious for some time after death, meaning that funerals
become very dangerous loci of potential infection for mourners.</p>
<p><img alt="Disease types" src="_images/disease-types.png" /></p>
<p>How long do the different periods last? For each disease there will be
typical durations, often with substantial variance. In the case of
ebola, for example, a typical timeline would be a 0–3 day
incubation period, a 7–12 day progression to recovery or death,
and a latent period of 2–5 days. The ranges give the variance of
periods, different for different individuals that depend on factors
including the severity of infection and the individual’s overall
health. However, the incubation period for ebola can be up to 21 days,
meaning that a suspected case needs to be quarantined for this period:
long enough, in other words, for the disease symptoms to manifest if
the person is actually infected. While one can test for most diseases
(including ebola) in a laboratory, during an epidemic such tests may
overwhelm the public health infrastructure, making quarantine the most
practical option. (During historical disease outbreaks, of course,
quarantine was the <em>only</em> option.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="measuring-and-modelling-epidemics">
<span id="sec-progress-r0"></span><h2>Measuring and modelling epidemics<a class="headerlink" href="#measuring-and-modelling-epidemics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Epidemiology is the science of creating models of diseases and their
spread that can be analysed, to make predictions or to simulate the
effects of different responses. To do this, we need to identify the
core elements of a disease from the perspective of transmission: we
typically do not need to understand the disease’s detailed biology,
only the timings and other factors that affect its spread.</p>
<p>We discussed above the periods of diseases, their relationships, and
their different, often characteristics, periods and variances. We need
some other numbers as well, however, and it turns out that these can
be measured directly in the field.</p>
<p>The most important number is the <strong>basic case reproduction number</strong>,
denoted <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span>. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> represents the total number of secondary
infections expected for each primary infection in a totally
susceptible population. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> stands for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t = 0\)</span>: the basic
case reproduction number applies at the start of an epidemic. Over
time, the number of people susceptible to infection will vary as they
become infected, recover, die, and so forth. We can account for this
by developing a <strong>net case reproduction number</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_t\)</span> by multiplying
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> by the susceptible fraction of the population at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> is affected by three factors:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>duration of infectiousness</strong>. All other things being equal, a
disease with a longer period of infectiousness has more time in which
to infect other patients.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>probability of transmission</strong> at each contact. Some diseases are
extremely contagious, with each contact having a high probability of
passing on the infection; others are much harder to pass on to
secondary cases.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>rate of contact</strong>. Someone coming into contact with a lot of
susceptible individuals will have more opportunities to generate a
secondary case than someone meeting fewer people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two factors are characteristic of the disease, derived from
its biology. The third is characteristic of the social conditions in
which the epidemic takes place: it is this factor that social
distancing, quarantine and so forth affect, by reducing (ideally to
zero) the contacts an infected person has with uninfected individuals.</p>
<p>As with disease periods, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> is an average that is affected by
various factors and is best treated as a mean value with some
variance: some infected individuals will affect more people, some
less, but <em>on average</em> they will generate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> secondary infections.
(This use of averaging means that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> if often not a whole number,
despite the number of secondary infections from a particular infected
person necessarily being so.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="controlling-epidemics">
<span id="sec-progress-control"></span><h2>Controlling epidemics<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-epidemics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The importance of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> is that it indicates whether, and how fast, a
disease can spread through a susceptible population. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0 \lt 1\)</span> then
we expect fewer than one secondary case per primary. This means that
each “generation” of the disese will be smaller than the one that
infected it, and the disease will die out. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0 = 1\)</span> then the
disease will perpetuate itself in whatever size of population was
originally infected. Nature is never so precise as to present us with
a disease like this, of course. However, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0 = 1\)</span> is the <strong>threshold
value</strong> at which diseases become epidemics. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0 &gt; 1\)</span>, the
disease will break-out and infect more and more people exponentially
quickly.</p>
<p>Exactly <em>how</em> quickly depends on how large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> is. For measles, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0
\ge 15\)</span> – fifteen new infections for each case – which
explains how measles spread so quickly in unvaccinated
populations. Different strains of influenza have different ranges of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span>: for the<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic">1918 “Spanish flu”
epidemic</a> it has been
estimated <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#vtm07" id="id2">[VTM07]</a> that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.2 \le R_0 \le 3.0\)</span> in the community
(although substantially more in confined settings). If this sounds
benign, remember that this epidemic killed more people than the First
World War. Perhaps interesting in light of its media coverage, for
ebola we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1.5 \le R_0 \le 2.7\)</span> <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="zbibliography.html#alt14" id="id3">[Alt14]</a>, roughly the same as
a not-too-severe winter flu outbreak.</p>
<div class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"></p>
<p>This will generally happen anyway through mutation and selection
as the disease agent evolves. It’s important to remember that mutation
is happening throughout an epidemic, meaning that a person infected
towards the end of an outbreak often gets a disease that is
<em>different</em> to so that experienced by someone infected earlier, and
this can sometimes have significant consequences.</p>
</div>
<p>In order to bring an epidemic under control, then, we need to reduce
the <strong>effective</strong> value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_0\)</span> over time.  We can quarantine
infected individuals so that they do not cause further secondary
infections. This is clearly more effective with Type B diseases than
with Type A, since the latter will have already become infectious
before they become symptomatic.</p>
<p>A more effective approach is to reduce the susceptible fraction of the
population. The approach is to make the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R_t\)</span> less than one
(the epidemic threshold) so that the disease dies out naturally. This
happens naturally in diseases to which individuals have natural or
acquired immunity, for example by surviving a bout of the disease.</p>
<p>An even more effective approach is to artificially give people
immunity: vaccination. A vaccine, where it exists, confers full or
partial immunity on its recipients, permanently or for some period.</p>
