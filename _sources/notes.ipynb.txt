    "<a name=\"continuous1\">[1]</a> In the computational epidemiology and network science literatures the parameter we've called $p_{\\mathit{infect}}$ is usually denoted $\\beta$, while $p_{remove}$ is denoted $\\alpha$. It's easier to understand what's going on if we spell the meaning of the symbols out.\n",

    "<a name=\"continuous2\">[2]</a> This approach to integration to get a time series, known as the *direct* or *Euler* method, isn't safe in general, as it risks falling foul of numerical instability in the equations. There are several more robust solutions for the more complex cases, notably the Runge-Kutta methods that are built into Python's `scipy` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"continuous3\">[3]</a> We've engaged in some mathematical sleight-of-hand here, in that what we've described as a *discrete* model (of people being susceptible, infected, and so on) has then be treated as a *continuous* model that represents the sizes of compartments as real numbers. In order to work in this way the three SIR equations should really be be phrased as *differential* equations rather than as *difference* equations so that the passage from discrete to continuous time makes mathematical sense. The results obtained are the same in both cases, however."
