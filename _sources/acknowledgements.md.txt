# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the students and collaborators who have helped me to get
more and more interested in complex networks over the years, and whose
knowledge and enthusiasm have been so motivating: Xue Guo, Peter Mann,
John Mitchell, Aleksejs Sazonovs, Saray Shai, Anne Smith, Mike
Pitcher. The fact that I still understand so poorly remains my fault.

Thanks to the friends and colleagues who asked about epidemic
modelling and were then sucked into commenting, proof-reading, and
listening to half-formed explanations: Muffy Calder, Lisa Dow, Ian
Gent, Fenella Hayes, Julie McCann, Riccardo Romano. No good deed goes
unpunished.

Thanks to the [School of Computer
Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science) at the
[University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk), for
providing both a stimulating academic home and access to the computing
resources needed to crunch the numbers.

This book would not exist without COVID-19. Whether that is something
to thank it for, or something further to blame it for, I leave to you.
