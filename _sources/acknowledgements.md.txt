# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the students who have helped me to get more and more
interested in complex networks over the years, and whose knowledge and
enthusiasm have been so motivating: Xue Guo, Peter Mann, Aleksejs
Sazonovs, Saray Shai, Mike Pitcher. The fact that I still understand
so poorly remains my fault.

Thanks to the friends and colleagues who asked about epidemic
modelling and were then sucked into commenting, proof-reading, and
listening to half-formed explanations: Muffy Calder, Lisa Dow, Ian
Gent, Fenella Hayes, Julie McCann, Riccardo Romano. No good deed goes
unpunished.

Thanks to the [School of Computer
Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science) at the
[University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk), for
providing both a stimulating academic home and access to the computing
resources needed to crunch the numbers for my experiments.

This book would not exist without COVID-19. Whether that is something
to thank it for, or something further to blame it for, I leave to you.
