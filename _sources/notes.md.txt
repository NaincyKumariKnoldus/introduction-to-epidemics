# Notes on software 

Simulations are all expressed using the
[`epydemic`](https://pyepydemic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for
network simulation, which is itself built on top of the
`networkx`library for representing and manipulating networks.

The mathematics and diagrams make heavy use of the `numpy` and
`matplotlib` libraries, together with `seaborn` to improve the
graphical presentation.

This book is written with a combination of "markdown" text and
[Jupyter](https://www.jjupyter.org) notebooks to allow executable
content. It was then assembled using [Jupyter
Book](https://jupyterbook.org).
