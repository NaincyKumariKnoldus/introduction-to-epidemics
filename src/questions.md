# Questions for discussion

## Models and modelling

- What can models tell us about real-world disease epidemics?
- Suppose you were asked to advise political leaders on the basis of
  what a model predicts. Would you? What would you want them to know
  about the process of modelling?


## Disease progression

- Think of a disease you've had. How did you catch it? Could you have
  done anything to *avoid* catching it? Was it made worse by where you
  lived at the time?
- What can be done to cope with "Type A" diseases, where people can
  transmission the disease without showing symptoms of it?
- Do you think the $\mathcal{R}$ number is a useful thing to keep track of
  during an epidemic? Why? (Or why not?)


## Compartmented models

- Look again at the graphs above. Are you surprised by them? Do they
  match how you think about, for example, winter flu?
- The numbers we've used in our model don't represent any particular
  disease. Do you think we could change that, so that our abstract
  model becomes more concrete? How might you do it?


## Network models

- We've now done two simulations of the same disease model: with
  equations, and with simulation. Which do you trust the results of
  more? Why?
- (For programmers.) How would you go about building a simulator for
  SIR? 
  

## Making fewer connections

- In a network model two people are either connected, or they
  aren't. Is that realistic? Could we change our model to make it
  reflect different "strengths of connection"? What might that let us
  do? 
- We say above that "changing $\langle k \rangle$ has the same effect
  as changing $p_{\mathit{infect}}$". Can you put that in less
  mathematical terms? What does it mean?
  
  
## Contact tracing

- Suppose you're been put in charge of tracking and tracing people's
  contacts. How would you do it? Is there any technology that would
  make the job easier?
- Tracing contacts is quite invasive of people's privacy. Is it
  justified when there's an epidemic happening? How about in "normal"
  circumstances?


## Epidemic threshold

- Where is all this variance coming from? -- aren't we getting
  exact answers by running simulations in a computer?
- The existence of an epidemic threshold suggests that some diseases
  never become epidemics. Is that right?
  
  
## Human contact networks

- Think about your friends and neighbours. Who are the "hubs? What
  makes them so?
- Rumours also spread through social networks: people pass information
  between each other. Could we model rumour-spreading (or "fake news")
  as a process over the network? Would it behave like a disease? Why?
  (Or why not?)
  

## Herd immunity

- How would you work out whether a particular disease conferred full
  immunity, or only partial immunity?
- Is partial immunity any help in managing a disease? -- it still
  leaves people at risk after infection
  

## Changing individual susceptibility

- What groups in society would you choose for targetted vaccination?
- Would you be happy *just* doing targetted vaccination, or would you
  want "general" vaccination too?
- If we never have a vaccine for a disease, how can we protect
  ourselves against it?


## Asymptomatic transmission

- What sort of detection activities might you impose in an epidemic?
  How effective would it be? What could you do to make it *more*
  effective?
- What would happen if you had vaccination *and* test, trace, and
  isolate in place at the same time? Would one compensate for
  weaknesses in the other?
  
  
## Physical distancing

- The case of Typhoid Mary raises some troubling questions. Is it
  right to lock someone up when they're done nothing personally wrong,
  to protect the community? What alternatives were there, before
  treatments like antibiotics were available? What might we do today?  
- Physical distancing doesn't have to be uniform for everyone. Some
  people are in more need of protection ("shielding") than others. How
  could we introduce this into a model?
