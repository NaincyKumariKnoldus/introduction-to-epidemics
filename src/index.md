# Epidemic modelling &ndash; Some notes, maths, and code

[Simon Dobson](mailto:simon.dobson@st-andrews.ac.uk)


We've unexpectedly found ourselves in a situation in which the science
of diseases is of critical importance to us all. On an individual
level, we want to know what to expect of vaccines or other
therapies. At a population level. we want to know how diseases become
epidemics and then pandemics, and how the different strategies might
influence their course. Above all, we want certainty that the disease
will be conquered and the future will be better.

Scientists don't really *do* certainty, though. All of science
is based around *models* that we construct to tell us about the things
we're interested in, and *experiments* we conduct to see to what extent
the models match the reality on the ground. It's this combination of
model and experiment, trial and error and correction, that help us
understand the world.

But what *is* a model of a disease? How do they work, and what can they
tell us about what we can expect from epidemics and other events? I'm writing
this document as an attempt to explain the one small corner of this
vast field that I know something about: how to model epidemics using
network science and computer simulations. I put it out as a work
in progress in the hope that it'll be interesting and useful to someone.
