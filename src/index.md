# Epidemic modelling &ndash; Some notes, maths, and code

[Simon Dobson](mailto:simon.dobson@st-andrews.ac.uk)

We've unexpectedly found ourselves in a situation in which the science
of diseases is of critical importance to us all. On an individual
level, we want to know what to expect of lockdowns, vaccines or other
therapies. At a population level, we want to know how diseases become
epidemics and then pandemics, and how the different strategies might
influence their course. Above all, we want certainty that the disease
will be conquered and the future will be better.

Scientists don't really *do* certainty, though. All of science is
based around the *models* that we construct to tell us about the
things we're interested in, and the *experiments* that we conduct to
see whether the models match the reality on the ground. It's
this combination of model and experiment, trial and error and
correction, that help us understand the world.

But what *is* a model of a disease? How do they work, and what can
they tell us about what we can expect from epidemics and other events?
I'm writing this book as an attempt to explain the one small corner of
this vast field that I know something about: how to model epidemics
using network science and computer simulations. It isn't in any way
comprehensive, leaving  huge areas unexplored and a huge number of
questions unanswered. I make it available as a work in progress in the
hope that it may be useful and may encourage an interest in science.
