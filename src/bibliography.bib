note = "An application of network-based epidemiology to computer viruses. The mathematics of spread are essentially identical, and even the methods of infection -- through contacts between 'infected' and 'susceptible' computers -- are sufficiently analogous to make the two systems behave very similarly. The main differences come because computer viruses, unlike 'natural' diseases, are targetted at specific hosts. This can be a lot more effective (in the short term, at least) than random evolution.",
