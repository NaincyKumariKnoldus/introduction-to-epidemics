# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the students who have helped me to get more and more
interested in complex networks over the years, and whose knowledge and
enthusiasm have been so motivating: Xue Guo, Peter Mann, Aleksejs
Sazonovs, Saray Shai, Mike Pitcher. The fact that I still understand
so poorly remains my fault.

Thanks to the friends and colleagues who asked about epidemic
modelling and were then sucked into proof-reading: Lisa Dow, Ian Gent,
Fenella Hayes, Riccardo Romano. No good deed goes unpunished.

Thanks to the [School of Computer
Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science) at the
[University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk), both for
providing a stimulating and rewarding academic home and also for
providing access to the computing resources needed to crunch the
numbers for these experiments.

This book would not exist without COVID-19.
