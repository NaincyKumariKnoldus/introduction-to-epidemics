# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the students and collaborators who have helped me to get
more and more interested in complex networks over the years, and whose
knowledge and enthusiasm have been so motivating: Xue Guo, Peter Mann,
John Mitchell, Aleksejs Sazonovs, Saray Shai, Anne Smith, Mike
Pitcher. The fact that I still understand so poorly remains my fault.

Thanks to the friends and colleagues who asked about epidemic
modelling and were then sucked into commenting, proof-reading, and
listening to half-formed explanations: Muffy Calder, Lisa Dow, Lei
Fang, Ian Gent, Fenella Hayes, Julie McCann, Riccardo Romano, Juan
Ye. No good deed goes unpunished.

Thanks to the School of Computer Science at the University of St
Andrews for providing both a stimulating academic home and access to
the computing resources needed to crunch the numbers.

This book would not exist without covid-19. Whether that is something
to thank it for, or something further to blame it for, I leave up to you.
